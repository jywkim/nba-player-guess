## Notes

As a basketball fan, I loved playing [Poeltl](https://poeltl.dunk.town/) and I thought it would be fun to build a clone. Project goals included using React learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with new features.

Initially I pulled data from [balldontlie API](https://www.balldontlie.io/) because I couldn't find an official NBA API. I then discovered the documentation for the [NBA Stats API](https://github.com/kshvmdn/nba.js) Node.js library and started using the endpoints from there. I began this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate.
